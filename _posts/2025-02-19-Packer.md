The first step was to determine what kind of file we were dealing with. This is like checking a book’s cover before opening it. By analyzing the file’s structure, it became clear that it was a Linux executable (a program that can be run on a Linux system). However, something was unusual—this file lacked section headers, meaning it had been altered in some way.. 

For this example im going to open up Kali Linux and start running commands on the file named 'out'

 

```bash
binwalk out
```

Binwalk is a tool used for analyzing binary files and detecting embedded files or compression.
It scans for signatures of known formats (like archives, images, or encryption).
The output tells us:
The binary is an ELF 64-bit executable (Linux program).
The file contains UPX compression (Copyright string: "Copyright (C) 1996-2018 the UPX Team.").
Offset 0x4AFA5 suggests where UPX starts compressing the data. 

Next command

```bash
upx -d out         
```

UPX (Ultimate Packer for Executables) is a tool that compresses binaries to reduce size.
The -d flag tells UPX to decompress (unpack) the binary.
The output confirms the file was successfully unpacked:
pgsql
The binary grew from 336 KB to 877 KB, meaning the original code has been restored.

Then we want to verify the file to see if its been stripped or not

```bash
file out         
```

After unpacking, file out now shows:
pgsql
CopyEdit
out: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, statically linked, not stripped

"Not stripped" means function names and symbols are still intact, making analysis easier.

Now lets run the program

```bash
chmod +x out
./out         
```

Chmod +x out makes the file executable.
./out runs the program.
The program prompts for a password, meaning there is a check inside the binary.

Lets check the file for anything with "pass" or "key" in it

```bash
strings out | grep -i pass
strings out | grep -i key       
```

Strings out extracts readable text from the binary.
grep -i pass filters lines containing "pass".

This suggests the flag is already inside the binary in hex format.

Last step is to convert the hex to text format

```bash
echo 7069636f4354467b5539585f556e5034636b314e365f42316e34526933535f39343130343638327d | xxd -r -p      
```

Echo outputs the hex string.
xxd -r -p converts hex to text.
This reveals the flag in the format picoCTF{...}
